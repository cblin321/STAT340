1. Binomial(20, .2) = 4
Normal(4, 4^2) = 4
Poisson(4) = 4
Exponential(.25) =  4

The mean is the same, so select every option

2. C

3. D

4. A, C, D

Expectation is a linear fcn (put E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b
Variance is not linear, but Var(A + B) = Var(A) + Var(b) \iff A and B are independent

5. c, .68 + .16 (LEFT TAIL NOT COVERED BY EMPIRICAL RULE)

6.
	a. TP
	b. FN
	c. FP
	d. TN

7. E (seldom see values close to 0)

The P-value should be a tail

8. A

Since this is taken directly from the sample we can say it converges the the law of large numbers to some fixed value.

9. E

This is an estimator (mean in this case) on a statistic that is taken from the sample, this changes with the number of observations.

In short, if there's a function on a statistic taken from the sample it will not converge.

SA1: D, we assume that each observation is independent (crows height shouldn't convey information about other crows height) and centered around a mean with constant variance, reasonable given human distributions. Let this distribution model the height of crows observed.

SA2: 
	a. 8/12
	b. Yes becuase you ahve a 12/48 chance of success, and the goemetric distribution returns the number of candies at random
	c. No, because for them to be mutually exclusive you cannot get a dark candy and a liked color at the same time, but getting a blue candy is a counterexample.
	d. Yes, P(A|B) = P(A) P(Dark | Liked) = 4/12, P(Dark) = 16/48.

SA3:
	a. 4/41
	b. 43/50
	c. 39 + 50 / 100
	d. Trimax C since it minimizes FN, which would lead to more spreading of the disease. FP is not that bad.
